![](http://img.dxcdn.com/productimages/sku_121326_1_small.jpg)A while ago I had the idea of using [cheap bluetooth modules](http://www.dealextreme.com/p/bluetooth-board-module-4-pin-121326) to operate an Arduino from a mobile phone, thus saving the expense of an IOIO board (or similar).  I purchased the module, but it didn't arrive during a period of unemployment and I never got around to doing anything with it.

[Someone beat me to it](http://www.instructables.com/id/Androino-Talk-with-an-Arduino-from-your-Android-d/).

I'll have to give it a go one day.  This will save me the trouble of doing it myself!

I wasn't sure whether a slave device would be fine, or whether I'd have to get the bluetooth module running in master mode.  Someone [has found out how to upload different firmware versions](http://byron76.blogspot.com/), to allow  master mode in these devices.
