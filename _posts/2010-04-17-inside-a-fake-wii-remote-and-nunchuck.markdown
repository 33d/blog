A while ago I bought [a fake Wii remote and nunchuck](http://cgi.ebay.com.au/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=170425047019) to play with (I don't actually own a Wii).  My tri-wing screwdriver arrived a few days ago, and here's what their insides look like (you can contrast with [the real thing](http://www.sparkfun.com/commerce/tutorial_info.php?tutorials_id=43)) (click on a picture for higher resolution, and more pics):

It turns out the peripherals are [easy to use with a microcontroller](http://www.littlebirdelectronics.com/products/WiiChuck-Adapter.html).  Since the nunchucks can be [had for under $6](http://www.dragonext.com/game/nintendo-wii/controller/for-nintendo-wii-black-nunchuck-controller-brand-new.html), its easily the cheapest way to add an accelerometer to a project.  ([Wireless ones are about $14.](http://www.dragonext.com/game/nintendo-wii/controller/wireless-nunchuck-remote-controller-for-nintendo-wii.html))
