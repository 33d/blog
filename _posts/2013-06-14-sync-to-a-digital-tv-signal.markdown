I remembered seeing some command which could synchronize the system clock to the digital TV (DVB) signal. This is ideal for a MythTV box which isn't connected to the internet.Â  It's `dvbdate`. One problem: [it ignores the system time zone](http://www.mythtv.org/wiki/Dvbdate). It can use the `TZ` environment variable, whose current value can be obtained using the date `command`:

    
    date +'%z'


so this will set the date:

    
    sudo TZ=$(date +'%:z') dvbdate --set


so you can put this script in `/etc/cron.hourly`, and make it executable:

    
    #!/bin/sh -e
    TZ=$(date +'%:z') dvbdate --set
