I heard about a simple circuit the other day that can light an LED of as little as 0.3V or even [a lemon](http://wiki.waggy.org/dokuwiki/electronics/joulethief#lemon_vampire).  [This page analyzes it](http://wiki.waggy.org/dokuwiki/electronics/joulethief) in loads of detail, and suggests adding a capacitor and diode to improve the circuit's efficiency considerably.
